# What is Objection.js?

Objection.js is an ORM for node. Objection is build on an SQL builder called knex.

To use objection.js all you need to do is initialize knex and give the knex instance to objection.js using `Model.knex(knex)`. Doing this installs the knex instance globally for all models.

## Models

A model subclass represents a database table and instances of that class represent rows. Models are created by inheriting from the `Model` class. A model can define relationships to other models using the static `relationMappings` property.

Models can optionally define a `jsonSchema` object that is used for input validation. Every time a model instance is created, it is validated against the `jsonSchema`.

Each model must have and id column. The id column name can be set using the `idColumn` property, but defaults to "id".

In objection, all configuration is done through Model classes and there is no global config or state. There is no "objection instance". This allows you to create isolated components.

You can also create a `BaseModel` class and inherit all your models from that.

Model Example:

```
const { Model } = require('objection');

class MinimalModel extends Model {
    static get tableName() {
        return 'someTableName';
    }
}
module.exports = MinimalModel;
```

### Custom Methods

```
const { Model } = require('objection');

class Person extends Model {
  // Table name is the only required property.
  static get tableName() {
    return 'persons';
  }

  // Each model must have a column (or a set of columns) that uniquely
  // identifies the rows. The column(s) can be specified using the `idColumn`
  // property. `idColumn` returns `id` by default and doesn't need to be
  // specified unless the model's primary key is something else.
  static get idColumn() {
    return 'id';
  }

  // Methods can be defined for model classes just as you would for
  // any JavaScript class. If you want to include the result of these
  // method in the output json, see `virtualAttributes`.
  fullName() {
    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
  }

  // Optional JSON schema. This is not the database schema!
  // No tables or columns are generated based on this. This is only
  // used for input validation. Whenever a model instance is created
  // either explicitly or implicitly it is checked against this schema.
  // See http://json-schema.org/ for more info.
  static get jsonSchema() {
    return {
      type: 'object',
      required: ['firstName', 'lastName'],

      properties: {
        id: { type: 'integer' },
        parentId: { type: ['integer', 'null'] },
        firstName: { type: 'string', minLength: 1, maxLength: 255 },
        lastName: { type: 'string', minLength: 1, maxLength: 255 },
        age: { type: 'number' },

        // Properties defined as objects or arrays are
        // automatically converted to JSON strings when
        // writing to database and back to objects and arrays
        // when reading from database. To override this
        // behaviour, you can override the
        // Model.jsonAttributes property.
        address: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: {
            street: { type: 'string' },
            city: { type: 'string' },
            zipCode: { type: 'string' }
          }
        }
      }
    };
  }

  // This object defines the relations to other models.
  static get relationMappings() {
    // Importing models here is a one way to avoid require loops.
    const Animal = require('./Animal');
    const Movie = require('./Movie');

    return {
      pets: {
        relation: Model.HasManyRelation,
        // The related model. This can be either a Model
        // subclass constructor or an absolute file path
        // to a module that exports one. We use a model
        // subclass constructor `Animal` here.
        modelClass: Animal,
        join: {
          from: 'persons.id',
          to: 'animals.ownerId'
        }
      },

      movies: {
        relation: Model.ManyToManyRelation,
        modelClass: Movie,
        join: {
          from: 'persons.id',
          // ManyToMany relation needs the `through` object
          // to describe the join table.
          through: {
            // If you have a model class for the join table
            // you need to specify it like this:
            // modelClass: PersonMovie,
            from: 'persons_movies.personId',
            to: 'persons_movies.movieId'
          },
          to: 'movies.id'
        }
      },

      children: {
        relation: Model.HasManyRelation,
        modelClass: Person,
        join: {
          from: 'persons.id',
          to: 'persons.parentId'
        }
      },

      parent: {
        relation: Model.BelongsToOneRelation,
        modelClass: Person,
        join: {
          from: 'persons.parentId',
          to: 'persons.id'
        }
      }
    };
  }
}
